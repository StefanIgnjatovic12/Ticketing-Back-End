1. Apps
- Users
- Tickets
- Projects
- User/Project management

- Project-wide functionality
  * Tables containing info should be paginated
  * Tables should be sortable
  * Should be able to increase/decrease number of entries shown


2. Models
For Users
- Admin - can do everything
- Developer - can change status of ticket
- Submitter - can create new tickets
- Project managers - can assign users and developers to tickets
- Demo ?

- Relationships: One to many

For tickets
- Ticket
    - Tickets have varying levels of severity
    - Types of ticket? Bug report, feature request? Doesn't really matter, just want the functionality of having multiple
    - Fields: (Title, Description, Priority, Submitter, Type, Status (open/closed etc), Date created, Date updated,
                Assigned developer - automatically assign developer with least tickets already assigned to them?)

    - Main ticket page contains: * Ticket details (fields above), Ticket comments, Ticket history (all changes to ticket and when they happened
                                 ie new dev assigned, new comment made, change in ticket status etc)
                                 * Option to edit ticket - Admin can change everything, Dev can change the status, Project manager can change assigned dev)
                                 * All tickets - see all tickets visible to you - Admin sees all, Dev sees all tickets for project they're working on
                                 (dev can also filter to tickets assigned to them directly), Project manager sees tickets for project assigned to them
                                 (everybody can filter tickets by project, type, dev, status, priority, date and title)

    - Relationships: * One to Many with comment
                     * Many to Many with Users
                     * Many to one with Projects

- Comment
    - Fields (Commenter, Message, Date created)
    - Can be edited by Submitter and can be edited/deleted by Admin

Projects
- Many to Many with and Users
- Project page contains: * Project name and project description
                         * Assigned personnel
                         * Tickets belonging to said project

Dashboard
- Have dashboard that differs based on which type of user
  - For Admin: List of all projects, manage user roles ie make user a developer or submitter etc,
  - For project manager: list of all projects
  - For submitter: List of projects you're assigned, list of tickets you've made
  - For Dev: list of projects you're assigned, list of tickets you've been assigned

Maybe ingrain messaging IM tool? Maybe useless?
